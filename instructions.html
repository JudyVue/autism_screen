      <h1>Instructions</h1>
      <p>The primary goal of the M-CHAT-R is to maximize sensitivity, meaning to detect as many cases of ASD as possible. Therefore, there is a high false positive rate, meaning that not all children who score at risk will be diagnosed with ASD.<br>

      Please check with a physician if you have health questions or concerns.<br>
      Please answer each question truthfully by selection yes or no and when you donâ€™t know, go with your best guess. Keep in mind how your child usually behaves. If you have seen your child do the behavior a few times, but he or she does not usually do it, then please answer no.</p>
