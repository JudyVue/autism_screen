    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>The primary goal of the M-CHAT-R is to maximize sensitivity, meaning to detect as many cases of ASD as possible. Therefore, there is a high false positive rate, meaning that not all children who score at risk will be diagnosed with ASD.<br>

    Please check with a physician if you have health questions or concerns.<br>
    Please answer each question truthfully by selection yes or no and when you don’t know, go with your best guess. Keep in mind how your child usually behaves. If you have seen your child do the behavior a few times, but he or she does not usually do it, then please answer no.</p>
